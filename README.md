# Menu Mastery: Analyzing Customer Preferences at Taste of the World Cafe

## Business Task: 
The primary goal of this project is to closely examine the orders at Taste of the World Cafe, with a specific focus on the performance of the new menu. The aim is to understand which menu items and types of food are most popular, faciliating informed decisions about future offerings. 

## Key Objectives: 
1. Menu Performance Analysis:
- Starting by assessing each menu item, we aim to identify customer preferences and understand the pricing dynamics within each category. This analysis guides decisions on what stays on the menu based on customer likes and budget considerations.
2. Order Optimization Based on Patterns:
- Another crucial aspect is understanding when customers usually place orders and what they tend to order together. This information helps in organizing the menu to better align with customer preferences and streamline kitchen operations.
3. Characteristics of High-Spending Orders:
- By combining information about menu items with order details, we seek to identify popular and less popular categories. Additionally, we examine orders with higher spending to understand customer preferences, enabling improvements to the menu and more effective marketing.

## Key Questions and Objectives:
Throughout the project, we'll address key questions:
- How well are the menu items performing, and what are the prices within each category?
- When do customers typically place orders, and how can the menu be organized to match their preferences?
- Which categories are most popular when considering both menu and order data, and what insights do high-spending orders provide about customer preferences?

This project represents a significant step in the commitment to enhancing the dining experience at Taste of the World Cafe. The insights gained will not only improve the current menu but also guide future planning using data-driven decisions.
