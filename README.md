# User Menu Mastery: Enhancing Taste, Boosting Revenue

## Business Goal: 
This project dives into Taste of the World Cafe's orders to revamp up their new menu. The aim is to figure out what people love and use that knowledge to plan future offerings.

## Project Objectives: 
1. *Understanding Preferences:* Understand what people dig from the menu and figure out the right prices. This helps decide what stays on the menu, balancing what people like with what fits their wallets.
2. *Operational Efficiency:* Know when people order and what they usually pick together. This helps organize the menu better, so it matches what people want, making the kitchen run smoother.
3. *High-Spending Patterns:* Combining menu and order info helps spot the winners and losers. Checking out the high-spending orders lets tweak the menu right and market it better.

## Key Questions:

Throughout this journey, we're tackling these questions:

1. *Menu Evaluation:* How are the menu items doing, and what's the right price for each category?
2. *Order Timing:* When do folks usually order, and how can the menu be set up to match their tastes?
3. *Popular Categories:* Which categories are a hit when looking at both the menu and orders, and what can big spenders tell about what customers like?
